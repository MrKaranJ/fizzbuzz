# [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

This is a simple interview screening question that finds number that are divisible by some number a or b or both. It originally started as a children's game and is trivial to solve using a program. Just looping until 'n' such numbers are generated is done using the developed function. The program can be tested by running 'main.py'.
